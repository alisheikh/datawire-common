Introduction to Datawire
########################

Microservice architectures can bring many benefits: greater
development velocity, more efficient resource utilization, better
code reuse, and the ability to use different languages and tools
for different tasks. Microservices can also be hard: they're
distributed systems and they require new skills and DevOps
infrastructure to deploy.

Datawire lets you build composable, resilient microservices quickly
and easily. Intended for software developers, Datawire takes care of
the intricacies of building a distributed system so developers can
just focus on the code they need to write. Used in conjunction with
rapid deployment technologies such as Docker and CoreOS (although you
certainly don't have to), Datawire enables you to deploy a
sophisticated microservice architecture that can scale with your
customers.

In the subsequent pages, we'll talk about what we mean by
composability and resilience, and how Datawire lets you achieve those
goals.
